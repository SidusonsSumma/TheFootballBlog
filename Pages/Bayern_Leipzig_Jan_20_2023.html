        <p>The Bundesliga’s biggest club faces off against a controversial upcoming club in the Bundesliga. Bayern Munich vs RB Leipzig. Honestly, there weren’t too many exciting things that we saw in this game. The only real narrative is RB Leipzig’s rise as competitors in the Bundesliga.</p>

        <p>First Half Thoughts (1-0, Bayern leads)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mostly a sloppy match on both sides.</li>
            <li>Leipzig was mostly contained, and the few times they broke, it never really felt that threatening as the Bayern defense contained them. The commentators point out very often that Leipzig lacks pace in their attack, much of which is going away with Christopher Nkunku, while Timo Werner remains on the bench. Not much for Yann Sommer to do on his debut.</li>
            <li>Bayern also a bit sloppy, especially while passing the ball in their own half. But whenever Leroy Sané gets the ball, something happens. Easily the man of the match so far.</li>
            <li>Goretzka has been helpful in disrupting Leipzig as well.</li>
            <li>Musiala’s been quiet. He had a few moments where it looked like he could break, but those were stopped by Leroy Sané slipping, and Xaver Schlager fouling him. It’s a bit annoying to not see Musiala just break through, but obviously the smart move from Schlager to prevent Musiala from going forward any further. The other time Musiala’s dribbling was showcased was in escaping a few Leipzig players around the midfield area, which resulted in a foul.</li>
            <li>Alphonso Davies has also helped escape some bad positions in the defensive area.</li>
            <li>Not the most entertaining game so far, Leipzig started off better from what I heard (but didn’t watch), but over the course of the half Bayern took control and  Bayern was clearly the better team in the first half. Leipzig has historically given Bayern a lot of trouble, but today it seems like Bayern is just better. It feels like a game that both teams are playing having just woken up a few minutes before. To be fair, we’re coming off the winter break during which there was also a World Cup, so… a few other Bayern chances were Gnabry hitting the post, and a set piece which resulted in a Goretzka goal but was called off due to a questionable foul call.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Second Half Thoughts (FT: 1-1)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I missed the first 7 minutes. And right when I got back to the game, it was 1-1. From when I started watching, it was a much more aggressive Leipzig in the second half to start. Up until around the 70 minute mark, Leipzig controlled the second half.</li>
            <li>For the neutral, a good game regarding the title race, but not necessarily that entertaining. As a Bayern fan, an irritating game. After the 70 minute mark, Bayern seemed just a slight bit better, but nowhere near enough to really break Leipzig down and take the lead.</li>
            <li>Sané still good in the second half, but once he moved more centrally his effectiveness was limited. People always talk about “oh, what if this player was in their proper position”, but what’s become obvious is that you can’t really predict a player’s performance based on position, and the so-called “best position” of most players is always changing in the public eye. But even after being moved, Sané wasn’t bad or anything, just less effective than in the first half.</li>
            <li>Musiala was subbed off for Coman, a quiet game for Musiala, not that much impact from Coman.</li>
            <li>It was unrealistic to expect, but I was hoping to see one of Wanner or Ibrahimovic in this game. At least we got to see Tel, who had a bit of an impact, but with just 6 minutes didn’t do all that much.</li>
            <li>Thank God for De Ligt and Upamecano. These two + Kimmich and Goretzka in midfield = a good backbone for our team, as long as Goretzka puts in defensive effort. Bayern tends to rush the attack and be a little mindless in Bundesliga games sometimes, though, which isn’t really present in the Champions League.</li>
            <li>Yeah, not that much to really say about the game. It’s a bit of an uneasy game from a Bayern fan’s point of view, because we just couldn’t impose ourselves on this game in the second half. To be fair, Leipzig is a good team, they’ve been good for the Bundesliga and have proven themselves to be a competitive team in the Champions League as well, despite usually drawing into tough groups. They’ve picked up wins over the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester City (but never Bayern Munich so far). I’m looking forward to competing with them for the next decade in the Bundesliga, though I wish Bayern could’ve done more against them today.</li>
            <li>With the way the game was going, subbing in Timo Werner did scare me a bit. The Leipzig jerseys look better on him than Chelsea does, but as a Bayern fan, I’m glad there wasn’t that much of an impact.</li>
            <li>Scrappy game, not much positives to take away. For Bayern, the next games have to be better, but after the break, it's a bit excusable.</li>
        </ul>
