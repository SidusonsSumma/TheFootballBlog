        <h1>Match Thoughts: January 28, 2023 - Bayern Munich vs Eintracht Frankfurt</h1>
    </center>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>I wasn’t able to watch the Köln game, but I’ll try to do this as regularly as I can - at least for Bayern games. Another big matchup in the Bundesliga today, Bayern Munich against Europa League holders Eintracht Frankfurt and one of the 4 Bundesliga clubs in the Champions League knockouts right now. Frankfurt are a team that have been on the rise for a while now, and they have many threatening players including Lindström, Götze, and especially Kolo Muani. They have a strong midfield and one of the best goalkeepers in the league in Kevin Trapp. Bayern are currently just one point ahead of Leipzig, and tied with Union Berlin at the top - though Union have already played their match, Bayern have theirs ahead of them.</p>

    <div>
        <p>First Half Thoughts (1-0, Bayern Leads)</p>
        <p>Starting XIs: <br>
            Bayern (4-2-3-1) Sommer; Davies - De Ligt - Upamecano - Stanisic; Musiala - Kimmich; Coman - Müller - Sané; Choupo-Moting <br>
            Frankfurt (3-4-3) Trapp; Ndicka - Hasebe - Tuta; Knauff - Sow - Rode - Buta; Götze - Kolo Muani - Lindström
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Early on, Frankfurt pinned back in their half. But not much done yet with that for Bayern.</li>
            <li>Around 9 minutes in now. Bayern with a first threatening attack.</li>
            <li>Bayern almost just gave away a goal on the corner. Corners have really been making me nervous as a Bayern fan.</li>
            <li>The inclusion of Müller back in the starting XI seems to have paid off today so far.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I think the Davies-Coman duo on the left has been very ineffective today. Both are individually very talented players and have had great impact for the club before, but Davies’s passing has been inaccurate and Coman wins his 1v1, but that doesn’t always lead to much more than just beating one defender. The second half of Nagelsmann’s first season went downhill when we started relying on setting Davies and Coman up with 1v1 opportunities every possession.</li>
            <li>Another long-range attempt from Kimmich, which led to one of the goals of the season against Köln.</li>
            <li>(33’) Sané Goal! It’s been coming. Good performance so far from the team, Müller with the assist. Also good fight from Kimmich leading up to it, happy with his performance so far. Also good fight from Coman at first to win the ball in the lead up to the goal.</li>
            <li>A great run from Musiala. Another quiet game so far from him, but he’ll get back into it with some time.</li>
            <li>Against a lesser team than Frankfurt, it might be 3-0 right now. </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>Second Half Thoughts (FT: 1-1)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frankfurt getting more aggressive.</li>
            <li>So, so close just now. This is why teams don’t like to go forward against Bayern.</li>
            <li>Another good moment from Musiala. I’ll be keeping track of everything from him until he regains his happiness on the field.</li>
            <li>Frankfurt subs: Lindström off for Borré, Rode off for Kamada.</li>
            <li>Sané seemed a bit frustrated today.</li>
            <li>(69’) Kolo Muani Goal! Very well played by Kamada and Kolo Muani.</li>
            <li>Bayern subs: Coman off for Gravenberch, Sané off for Gnabry.</li>
            <li>It’s anyone’s game now, and Frankfurt know it.</li>
            <li>Bayern sub: Choupo-Moting off for Tel. Been hoping for Tel to come on.</li>
            <li>Kolo Muani’s been giving Upamecano trouble all match long.</li>
            <li>A few more normal Musiala moments in this game compared to the Leipzig game. Again, I missed the Köln game.</li>
            <li>Very threatening chance for Frankfurt, but they couldn’t finish.</li>
            <li>Frankfurt sub: Götze off for Jakic. More defensive sub.</li>
            <li>Bayern sub: Stanisic off for Sabitzer. Stanisic had a solid performance.</li>
            <li>Frankfurt sub: Kolo Muani off for Alidou.</li>
            <li>A third straight 1-1 draw. Frankfurt had the last chance of the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="color:aqua;">Concluding Thoughts</p>
        <p>More to say about this game than Leipzig. Honestly, I felt better about this game than the Leipzig game. With Leipzig, it felt like the game was just stagnant. With Frankfurt, perhaps we lost control at the end, but we had a good first half and Musiala seemed to gain some of his rhythm back in the second half. Frankfurt are also a good team. They’re in the Champions League knockout stages, they won the Europa League - the Bundesliga is not easy right now. Historically, Frankfurt have also been one of the teams that give us trouble. The more concerning thing, though, was that Bayern looked tired late in the second half.</p>
        <p>Müller was very, very effective in that first half. A good Müller makes a good Bayern. We have to be ready for the day Müller retires because as good as the rest of our players are, Müller just brings something different which changes the game. In our academy, maybe Arijon Ibrahimovic can fill that void when the day comes (I think Wanner’s just too different from Müller), but if not, we might need Florian Wirtz.</p>
        <p>In another year, being on top of the table at the midway point of the season might’ve immediately meant that this league was Bayern’s for the taking. Right now, Bayern were top of the table at the midway point, but with the lowest point count in a while (I forgot what the stat was) - 36 points. After this game, the Bundesliga table is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bayern Munich, 37 pts</li>
            <li>Union Berlin, 36 pts</li>
            <li>RB Leipzig, 35 pts</li>
            <li>SC Freiburg, 34 pts</li>
            <li>Eintracht Frankfurt, 32 pts</li>
            <li>Borussia Dortmund, 31 pts (yet to play)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Niko Kovac’s Wolfsburg are in 7th with 29 and have been playing well, then there’s a bit of a gap with Gladbach and Leverkusen at 25 and 24 respectively. Leverkusen have Florian Wirtz back, and Xabi’s start seems to have gone well - they might make a push too.</p>
        <p>I think we really have a title race this year. The games haven’t been easy for Bayern. Last season, the Rückrunde was not good for Bayern, culminating in a disastrous Champions League exit against Villareal. Here in Nagelsmann’s second season, it seems like that pattern might somewhat repeat, with a fantastic first half of the season, and a disappointing payoff in the second half. But I’m honestly more optimistic than other Bayern fans. I don’t think our attack has looked quite as stagnant as it did to start the second half last season. But when you have 4 teams in the Champions League knockouts, that just shows that the teams can be relied upon to win the games they need to win. Dortmund went straight at the hearts of Manchester City, Leipzig got a win off of Real Madrid.</p>
        <p>Yes, Bayern could’ve been better, but we created chances (we could’ve created more, but it also was an acceptable amount for Bayern standards), our attack was good in the first half (just okay in the second, not the worst, but definitely could be better  - again, we looked tired), and honestly I think this patch of form has just as much to do with the Bundesliga getting better. German academies are producing talents again, and some attractive players are playing for clubs that have good prospects now and for the future. Frankfurt and Leipzig are definitely two of those clubs.</p>
        <p>I might end up being proven very wrong, but for Bayern, I don’t think the second half of this season is quite lost yet - in fact, it might turn out really well. I think Bayern fans are jumping to conclusions too quickly, and scapegoating various individuals too quickly.</p>
        <p>That's all for today. I'm working on a few other articles to go along with the regular match thoughts.</p>
