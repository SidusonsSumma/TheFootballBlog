        <p>Champions League matchday, and one that all of Europe - scratch that, most of the entire planet outside of my lovely country the United States of America - has been waiting for. We beat them in the final in 2020, they beat us on away goals in 2021. Round 3 begins today.</p>
        <p>Most of the world is rooting for us. Only Argentina (for Messi), Brazil (multiple PSG players, and anti-Germany), Barcelona (8-2, 7-0, 3-0, 3-0, 2-0, 3-0…), maybe Costa Rica (Keylor Navas) and PSG fans themselves are with PSG.</p>
        <p>Kylian Mbappe won’t be starting, but it’s not like PSG lacks starpower. Kimmich is one yellow away from missing the second leg. The 2006-born Warren Zaire-Emery, part of the French U17 squad that won the U17 Euros this past summer (comprised mostly of 2005-born players, including our own Mathys Tel), gets a start on this huge night - he’s the youngest ever starter in a UCL knockout match. Müller won’t start, a risky choice. Time for Kimmich to progress his legacy as the great midfielder of his generation.</p>
        <p>I have no idea how this game will play out, but I trust our team. I think we all prefer Goretzka playing deeper now, and it’s been clear for a long time, he has a lot of ability defensively, it’s up to whether he wants to play defensively. This game will force him to have a more defensive mind.</p>
        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day everyone.</p>

        <p id="firstHalf">First Half Thoughts (0-0):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We’re attacking here early on.</li>
            <li>PSG almost broke free twice. Thank God for our new defense.</li>
            <li>Honestly Choupo seems to be a step behind right now. Coman our MOTM so far. We should buy Cançelo permanently. Not super effective so far or anything, but clearly with very high class.</li>
            <li>Great commentary: “Paris Saint-Germain’s relationship with the ball is an issue here at the moment, they don’t seem to like each other”.</li>
            <li>Sergio Ramos has been so annoying. What else could we expect?</li>
            <li>OUR DEFENSE has been so much better than previous years. Upa fulfilling his potential, De Ligt signing, now Cançelo as well and Pavard also getting back in form.</li>
            <li>We’ve had all the possession, but only one shot on target which was Kimmich’s. I think we can get a goal if things stay as they are, but Ramos especially has been more than annoying.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested Gnabry would actually be good for this game. Lowkey. Müller too.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p id="secondHalf">Second Half Thoughts (FT: 1-0, Bayern Wins):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Halftime Subs: Coman switches sides, Davies on for Cançelo for Bayern. Kimpembe on for Hakimi for PSG, they switch to a back 3. I do think that Davies's pace on that left side can help shift that PSG defense.</li>
            <li>Hasn’t started as controlled as the 1st half.</li>
            <li>COMAN GOAL LET’S GO!!! Davies cross, a very similar goal to the one that won us the Champions League in 2020, around the same time stamp too.</li>
            <li>DEFEND.</li>
            <li>Kylian Mbappé on, as well as Fabian Ruiz. Carlos Soler off, and Warren Zaire-Emery off. This is what I've been afraid of.</li>
            <li>Let’s not get sloppy right now.</li>
            <li>Good trap by Upa and Goretzka to rob Mbappé leading to a good chance for Choupo, but not the best strike.</li>
            <li>Another chance for Choupo! They’re opening up.</li>
            <li>Damn it Donnarumma. Saves our corner, headed by Pavard.</li>
            <li>Upamecano I love you. De Ligt too.</li>
            <li>That was scary. Mbappé got past us, but had some poorer touches. Ended up in the back of the net after some shots from Neymar and an Mbappé rebound, but Mbappé was offside.</li>
            <li>PSG sub: Vitinha on for Danilo.</li>
            <li>Bayern sub: Müller on for Choupo, Gnabry on for Coman who has been limping after a challenge.</li>
            <li>Pressure has been mounting against Bayern.</li>
            <li>Müller blasts it way off on the break. Could’ve really been 2-0. Maybe Musiala could’ve done better with his pass.</li>
            <li>FRICK. Mbappé equalizes.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, we can breath. Mendes was offside in the build up.</li>
            <li>Another chance, Messi blocked by Pavard’s deflection. Mendes again down that left flank.</li>
            <li>Chance after chance for PSG right now. LOCK IN GUYS.</li>
            <li>Ryan Gravenberch on for Musiala.</li>
            <li>Josip Stanisic on for Sané. Very defensive change. Last minute of the 90.</li>
            <li>A second yellow for Pavard. He’s off. 3 minutes of added time.</li>
            <li>FULL TIME. That was not a very comfortable ending. Bayern will have to be much, much better in the second half because they killed us once Mbappé came on.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p id="conclusion">Concluding Thoughts</p>
        <p>We have to be happy with taking a 1-0 lead back to Munich. We could’ve scored more, but at the same time, we have to be very relieved right now that PSG didn’t score in those last 20 minutes. That was not comfortable - Mbappé is and has been the game plan for PSG, and once he came on, it was a different game.</p>
        <p>We finished with 10 men, and we can’t blame Pavard for anything there. He gave his all for the club today, and got sent off with a very necessary challenge to prevent Messi from being clear. Well done Benji.</p>
        <p>There’s a section of Bayern fans that criticized the 1st half a lot. Sometimes, I think people can be too much about the doom and gloom, because while we didn’t create much, we contained Messi and Neymar, and PSG had absolutely nothing going for them. And I was right: in the end, that same amount of pressure ended up getting a goal for us.</p>
        <p>Coman was our best offensive player, but Kimmich and Goretzka were also very stable in the midfield. Upamecano and De Ligt, though, were absolutely fantastic for us. Bayern’s defense is good again and I couldn’t be happier. I’ll be saying it again and again because these two are stopping everything. Even they couldn’t contain Mbappé though. Mbappé is the world’s best player right now, there’s very little question.</p>
        <p>Not the best night for Musiala. He had some nice moments, but also a few where he didn’t seem to be as confident as he could’ve. But he skipped past defenders when he had the chance, just didn’t have a good final product at all.</p>
        <p>For the second leg, all I have to say, though, is that we must be on red alert. Mbappé is coming for us, and we have to be fully locked in. There will be no Pavard in the second leg, so a back 3 might not be as useful. But we need both Cançelo and Davies - Gnabry especially won’t cut it as a wingback defending against Mbappé, though Coman would be alright. But to be honest, we Bayern fans can have very little comfort, all we have is a bit of breathing room. I don’t think there’s any planning for the second leg that can truly contain Mbappé, we just have to be better in everything else, which we were in this game for 70 minutes. Physically and structurally, we were the better team by far. It’s just that some things can’t be controlled - namely, star power the likes of Mbappé’s caliber.</p>
