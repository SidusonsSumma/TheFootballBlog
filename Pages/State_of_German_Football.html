        <p>
            Though I'm not German, I’ve paid very close attention to the German National Team, and since Germany had another very disappointing World Cup, I wanted to write this article as a reflection on the current state of the German team, and give my thoughts on how to fix it. Before we take on the current state of German football, we need to take a look at the past and look for the warning signs. Germany has 4 World Cups and 3 Euros, indisputably the most storied footballing nation of Europe. It has made the World Cup semifinal an incredible 13 times, the most of any nation, and has appeared in the final 8 times - also the most of any nation. Most people know: the Germans know how to win football matches. But something strange has happened since its last World Cup win in 2014.
 
<br><br>Let us set the scene: It is the 27th of June, 2018. The defending champions of the World Cup, Germany, need just to beat South Korea - and by a reasonable goal margin - to advance from a group they had started poorly in. But as the game goes on frustration grows, as Germany plays with a cohort of disconnected star names and misses a number of big chances. Added minutes give Germany a chance to still advance, but instead, the Germans make a mess of a Korean corner kick which then finds its way to the feet of Kim Young-gwon who has an open goal before him. Kim’s goal, combined with Korean star Son Heung-min’s follow-up goal, send Germany home, bowing out of the World Cup group stage for the first time ever, and being knocked out of the first round of the tournament for the first time since 1938. It is a disaster of historic proportions for a nation of Germany’s footballing history. After some time to regroup, Germany sets its sights on 2022, seeking redemption.
 
<br><br>The subsequent years would confuse the German footballing public, rather than inspire hopes of redemption. A poor showing at the first edition of the UEFA Nations League saw Germany relegated - and then saved by an expansion of teams in the tournament - while friendly matches were rarely any more promising. All headlines asked what exactly was causing the decline of German football. Often the blame fell on the coach Joachim Löw, who had seen many of the glory years of Germany. Löw and many others had also thought that many of the triumphant 2014 squad had lost their touch and that it was time to move on from them. Most blamed German youth development for falling behind and failing to produce top quality players such as those of the 2014 squad. A whole mess was made of the situation, and Germany scrambled for answers, trying this and that and anything to try to sort themselves out for the near and distant future.
 
<br><br>There were moments of triumph for German football as Germans made a great impact on the Champions League in this time. In the summer of 2021, prior to the Euros, the U21 team impressed the German public and won the U21 Euro, outdoing the 2019 team which had also made it to the final. From many angles, the state of German football seemed to be in very good shape. But on the National Team front, the struggles continued, even getting worse until hitting a low point as the Euros approached. In the preparations for the 2020 UEFA Euros, to take place in 2021 due to a certain pandemic, Germany was whipped around by the Spanish in a historic 6-0 loss, while qualification for the 2022 World Cup was even put in temporary danger by an embarrassing 2-1 defeat to North Macedonia. It was at that point that an era came to a close, and Joachim Löw announced that the upcoming 2021 Euros would be his last tournament. His successor? The coach who led Bayern Munich to glory in 2020, and Löw’s assistant coach for the victorious 2014 team: Hansi Flick. So while the Euros would turn out to be another weak showing from the Germans, a few promising youngsters and the incoming Hansi Flick era promised to Germany that there was indeed a future for them, and that a return to the peak of planet football was imminent. This brings us to the current day, and an analysis of the status of German football. Today’s article will focus on the National Team, while the next will be focused on the Bundesliga.

            <h3>Part 1: The Beginning of the Hansi Flick Era</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
            The beginning of the Hansi Flick era was much like his start with Bayern Munich. His first match in charge was a modest 2-0 win over Liechtenstein. This was followed by a more encouraging 6-0 win over Armenia, a 4-0 win over Iceland, then a nervy 2-1 comeback win over Romania and then 4-0 revenge over North Macedonia and a 9-0 hammering over Liechtenstein. All of this was in World Cup qualifying, which became a cakewalk for Germany and led to Germany becoming the first nation to qualify for the World Cup. The Flick era seemed to be starting very well, and the general feeling was that Hansi Flick was truly about to revive the National team. But Flick was yet to face his first real test.
 
           <br><br>On March 29, 2022, Germany played a friendly game against the Netherlands, now under returning coach Louis Van Gaal - another former coach of Bayern Munich. The Germans were impressive - hit by a number of injuries including midfield leader Joshua Kimmich, but showing the world that they meant business. Before the half was over, Germany took a 1-0 lead from Thomas Müller’s strike, after having failed to convert a good number of chances. As the game approached its late stages and Hansi Flick made many substitutions (remember, it is a friendly game), the Dutch equalized and pushed on, looking to even win the game. It seemed that if anyone was going to get the second goal, it was probably the Netherlands - in fact, they probably deserved a penalty. But in the end, the Germans succeeded in impressing the footballing public. People began to really take the Germans seriously again as contenders for the upcoming World Cup. 
          
           <br><br>Next was the Nations League group stages. Germany had drawn into a group with Italy, England and Hungary. The Hungarians were the underdogs of the Euros group of death, which also had Germany as well as France and Portugal. They put up an admirable effort, nearly knocking the Germans out of another group stage and taking their own spot in the knockout rounds before Leon Goretzka equalized and sent Germany through. Italy and England were the finalists of the 2021 Euros, but while England seemed to be on an upward trajectory, Italy had suddenly missed out on the World Cup once again. They had also just gone through a hammering from Argentina in the new CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions. As a result, the Italians had brought a new batch of young players to the Nations League, setting up for a new generation to take over - largely experimenting with the many young Italian players spread throughout Serie A. They were Germany’s first opponents.
          
           <br><br>And while the previous matches from Flick’s Germany had seemed promising, the match against Italy was lackluster. Italy was able to take the lead through 18 year-old Wilfried Gnonto, to which you could visibly see a gear turn on in the German players who immediately responded with an equalizer. Germany pushed on for a few more minutes before returning to the mindset that the match was a friendly. The match ended 1-1. A frustrating result, but at least it was clear that Germany had the gears needed to just turn it on and score a goal.
          
           <br><br>Then against England, the Germans faced the team who knocked them out of the Euros. A tough match between two highly talented sides, Germany was noticeably more focused against the English than against the Italians. It was not an easy match, but Germany had the upper hand. Defensively the Germans looked impressive, not affording much space at all to England’s big name players, and collapsing on the ball as a unit, pressing very effectively. The possession was fluid, artistic even. It was not easy to get a goal, however, prior to Kimmich hitting a wonderful pass through a gap in England’s defense to find Jonas Hofmann who scored about 50 minutes into the game. After that it was more of Germany. The minutes passed, and England seemed dejected. But after about 70 minutes, substitute Jack Grealish came on, the difference maker in the Euro match between the two, and the game began to even out. Neuer was forced to make a great save against Harry Kane at point blank range. Then Harry Kane found himself offside but the referee still blew the whistle to give England a penalty, which Kane converted. The match ended 1-1, and while Germany and the rest of the footballing public felt that Germany had been robbed, the general sentiment was that the performance was there even if the result wasn’t. And so the Germans marched on with more confidence.
          
           <br><br>Germany then hit a stumbling block against the Hungarians. They had two Nations League matches in a row against Hungary, the first of which was another 1-1 draw - by this point it seemed that Germany was just incapable of winning in the Nations League but it hardly mattered: the Nations League was an irrelevant tournament - and the second a frustrating 1-0 loss. The narratives were suddenly flipped, as many now said that Flick’s Germany had no creativity. It was either a poor performance from Germany, or that Hungary were simply a superteam. The game was set aside as a warning shot for the Germans.
          
           <br><br>Then came the game that might most foreshadow the upcoming World Cup. Germany against England once again. Once again the Germans drove right at the heart of the English, and took a lead around the same 50 minute mark as Jamal Musiala won a penalty off of Harry Maguire - Ilkay Gündogan converted. But this time, Germany was able to get a second. Kai Havertz hit a wonderful shot from distance right off the post and into the net to double Germany’s lead. The game seemed to be over. But a few minutes later, England snuck in a goal through Luke Shaw, and soon after that, Mason Mount blasted a shot in to equalize. Nico Schlotterbeck then fouled Jude Bellingham near the inside edge of the penalty box and Harry Kane converted the penalty. Kai Havertz tapped in a rebound shot to save Germany from losing the match. It was embarrassing, and while Germany seemed so dominant for 70 minutes, they had once again collapsed against England with lackluster play and nearly bottled a game which seemed to be certainly over.
          
           <br><br>Germany ended the Nations League with a 5-2 hammering of the very inexperienced Italian side. The World Cup approached, and the early reviews of Flick’s Germany were mixed. On the one hand, they were so clearly a highly potent side that played very attractive football - for 70 minutes. On the other hand, they didn’t quite seem to be a winning side yet. Maybe it was too early for Hansi Flick, maybe the players weren’t quite ready to win a tournament. Question marks surrounded the team, but at the same time, there was a renewed belief in the National Squad that had been lost by the end of Joachim Löw’s reign. People knew Germany could win games again.
          
           <br><br>The team’s long-serving but often questioned striker Timo Werner was hit by an injury in the lead up to the World Cup. As a result, the then 17 year-old Youssoufa Moukoko who had begun to shine at Dortmund was called up, as well as Niclas Füllkrug, the Bundesliga’s top scorer and a player much of the German public demanded as a part of the World Cup squad. Since Miroslav Klose retired, the striker position had been a position of trouble for Germany. Was the problem solved?

            <h3>Part 2: The 2022 World Cup - Hansi Flick's First Tournament</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
            Group E: Germany, Spain, Japan and Costa Rica.
 
           <br><br>On November 23, 2022, Germany’s World Cup began with a match against Japan. The game began rather nervously for Germany, definitely wary of the danger that good counter-attacking teams can pose. Japan played very aggressively and in an organized way and Germany made a few questionable passes. But the early game nerves were minor, and as the game went on, Germany grew into the game - and began to dominate. Japan was pinned into their half, unable to escape. Germany was creating chances and left fans and players pulling out their hair for the missed opportunities to take the lead. Then David Raum found himself with just the Japanese keeper in front of him and the Japanese defense running back to meet him. He took a touch away from the keeper but was mauled in the process. Penalty for Germany. Gündogan converted. Germany had scored their first goal of the tournament, already a better start than 2018 - the eye test would suggest so too. The rest of the half was much of the same - German domination.
          
           <br><br>But then the second half started. The German players looked like they had just woken up from a nap. And the half opened with the German players - even Kimmich - playing sloppy passes, and in transition they moved as if they simply expected Japan to let them run their training exercises. There was little feeling that the Germans recognized that the Japanese were a true threat. They didn’t bother looking whether their passes would connect and didn’t bother scanning for incoming defenders when receiving the ball. There was no desire to control the game, simply a mindset of making whatever pass comes to mind rather than assessing the field of play itself. Still, Japan wasn’t really coming close to scoring yet, and Musiala had a few moments of individual brilliance which lacked only the finish. But soon enough, that carelessness began to punish Germany. Japan’s attacks began to really pose a threat, and after Neuer made a save, Ritsu Doan of Japan scored on the rebound. 1-1. And a few minutes later, after absolutely no response from the Germans, inexplicably bad defending from Nico Schlotterbeck and Niklas Süle put a Japanese player 1-on-1 with Manuel Neuer. No worry, it’s a tight angle, and it’s Neuer. There’s no way this’ll turn into a goal. The ball beat Neuer at his near post. 2-1 Japan. It was only then that Germany began to attack again, but without the pace and ruthlessness of the first half. A few subs were made including Niclas Füllkrug and Youssoufa Moukoko, neither of whom could find an equalizer for Germany in the 7 minutes of time left, nor the 7 minutes of extra time. Germany began their World Cup with a loss, one which left all German fans furious and unable to explain what on earth they just saw. The narrative was once again doom and gloom. Germany still had Spain to play, a Spanish side which had just smashed an, admittedly very weak, Costa Rica side 7-0. It seemed very likely that Germany would once again go out of the group stages, making it two in a row, and the first two in the history of the German National Team. All of the team was condemned - Flick’s tactics, the defenders, the political standoffs the German players participated in with the Qatari government. The response from the German fans was overwhelmingly one of anger. Regardless of any other factors, what everyone was left with was this simple takeaway: that second half was just awful.
          
           <br><br> A few days passed, and the German public had calmed down. The situation was this:
           <br><br>Spain had 3 points and a goal difference of 7
           <br><br>Japan had 3 points and a goal difference of 1
           <br><br>Germany had 0 points and a goal difference of -1
           <br><br>Costa Rica had 0 points and a goal difference of -7
          
           <br><br>The upcoming match was with Spain. Costa Rica was assumed to be the loser against Japan, but it would be considered even better for Germany if Japan would draw the match or even lose it. The assumed case was Japan has 6 points, but the best cases were Japan with 4 points or even 3, while Costa Rica also had 3. If Costa Rica beat Japan, even with a loss to Spain, Germany would still be in contention as long as the goal difference was not absurd to overcome - but only if Japan lost to Costa Rica. Both Japan and Costa Rica would be on 3 points, while Spain had 6 and Germany would have 0. Germany would be able to advance if Spain won against Japan and Germany beat Costa Rica by a good enough goal margin. But this would also open the door for Spain to simply throw their final game against Japan and knock Germany out - a scenario which many nations would certainly favor. But if Japan and Costa Rica drew, a draw with Spain would be needed and a win by a sufficient goal difference against Costa Rica would allow Germany through as well. The best case would obviously be to beat Spain. I won’t get into potential scenarios any more, as I’m sure further deliberation on the matter would cause headaches for a majority of readers. Let’s get to the match against Spain.
          
           <br><br>First, a miracle: Japan had lost to Costa Rica. Both of the group underdogs were now on 3 points. It was up to Germany, then, to get a draw at least against Spain.
          
           <br><br>The opening exchanges favored Spain. They held a majority of the possession, and created a few half-chances. But Germany was not beaten by any means. In fact it was Germany who put the ball in the back of the net first, but were unlucky that Antonio Rüdiger was offside. The first half ended scoreless, already noticeably a game of high quality.
          
           <br><br>The second half saw Germany take control of the game, creating the chances and even containing Spain in their half mostly. But against the run of play, striker Alvaro Morata scored the first goal for Spain. Germany then pushed, but opened themselves up to the Spanish counter which did yield a couple of chances for Spain. It was do-or-die now, as a loss would all but eliminate Germany from the competition. But as expected, Germany was able to create the chances they needed. Jamal Musiala was denied by goalkeeper Unai Simón 1v1. But it was no matter, a few minutes later, substitute Leroy Sané, who had missed the match against Japan due to injury, hit a ball to Musiala who flicked the ball on for Niclas Füllkrug. Füllkrug smashed the ball into goal and equalized for Germany. Germany pushed on, the likelier of the two teams to find a second. As the game drew to a close, Leroy Sané found himself clear and with just Unai Simón to beat, but a heavy touch stunted the opportunity. The game ended with a 1-1 draw, a game Germany was slightly unlucky to not win, but one which they couldn’t really be blamed for not winning. Germany could’ve won it, but the German fanbase settled with a result that mostly satisfied them. The table now:
          
           <br><br>Spain 4 points and with a goal difference of 7
           <br><br>Japan 3 points and with a goal difference of goal difference of 0
           <br><br>Costa Rica with 3 points and a goal difference of -6
           <br><br>Germany with 1 point and a goal difference of -1
          
           <br><br>Still a lot of work to do. At the very least, Germany needed to beat Costa Rica as long as Spain beat Japan - all the German players had gotten verbal assurances from their Spanish friends at their clubs that Spain would play for the win. If Spain and Japan drew, Germany would need to beat Costa Rica by at least 2 goals. But if Japan beat Spain, Germany would need to win the match by at least a goal difference of 8 minus whatever the goal difference between Spain and Japan was. It would be safer to assume a simple 1 goal win at best for Japan, and so for Germany, a 7 goal win over Costa Rica would see them through in the case of a Japan win and hopefully fair play favoring Germany. An 8 goal win would guarantee that Germany progresses from the group stages. As absurd as it sounds, it was definitely doable for Germany. And in any case, it was likely that Spain would win against Japan, or at least draw. After all, Spain’s players from Real Madrid and RB Leipzig had verbally assured the Germans that they would play for the win.
          
           <br><br>Germany scored early against Costa Rica. Spain scored early against Japan. Alright, all was well. It seemed now that Spain and Germany were surely through, with Germany settling with second in the group - they were okay with that. It was the easier path anyway, one which avoided the likes of Brazil and France. Germany cruised through the rest of the half, not really concerned that anything could go wrong. Costa Rica barely put up a fight as far as the Germans were concerned. Once again, Germany started to go through the motions. Half-hearted passes, half-hearted runs, simple defending to make sure Costa Rica didn’t do anything they weren’t supposed to. The first half ended 1-0 for both Germany and Spain.
          
           <br><br>Germany emerged from the halftime break with the first step of redemption in their sights. Surely now, they’d at least progress to the knockouts. But disaster in the other game struck early: Japan had equalized. No matter, Germany could simply get a second goal. Then Japan scored again soon after. 2-1 Japan. Everything was flipped on its head. How could this be? Germany now needed to score 7 more goals as they were equal on points with Spain, but far behind in goal difference due to Spain’s 7-0 win over Costa Rica. And in that panic, Costa Rica scored against the sloppiest of German defending. 1-1. And again, sloppy German defending. Were they dejected? 2-1 Costa Rica. In that moment it seemed that the two teams to progress from Group E would remarkably be Japan and Costa Rica. For neutral fans, the world was in paradise. For Germans and Spaniards, it was an embarrassment, but a rather amusing one. But neither team wanted to go out in the group stages. In the other game, Spain began to play with urgency. Germany quickly equalised. 2-2. Then in no time, 3-2 Germany. Very soon after, 4-2 Germany. Where was this earlier? Were they simply assuming the Spaniards were their friends? Had they not watched “The Princess Bride” (1987)? Inigo Montoya offered his word as a Spaniard to Westley that he’ll climb up the rock safely before they fight. Even Westley knew: “No good! I’ve known too many Spaniards” (I’m just kidding, don’t take that seriously). There is no proof that Spain lost on purpose, but I’m just saying, if anyone was going to help Germany, it wouldn’t be Spain. By losing to Japan, Spain would be second in the group and avoid Brazil in a potential quarterfinal. By losing to Japan, Spain would eliminate one of the World Cup’s biggest threats in Germany, doing a favor not only to themselves but every other nation remaining in the tournament. And to add onto that, this Spanish team was made up of many Barcelona players and a former Barcelona coach. Barcelona hates Bayern Munich, and Bayern Munich makes up much of the German team. Hansi Flick was the very coach responsible for that 8-2 demolition of Barcelona in the 2020 Champions League. While the Spaniards know that Germany is not winning 8-0 against Costa Rica, Spain surely was not thinking to themselves that it was urgent to get a goal and draw the game against Japan. But aside from this mindless speculation, it is foolish in general for the Germans to rely on anyone else to help them out (by the way I'm also just kidding about Spain throwing the game on purpose).
          
           <br><br>Germany awaited the results of Spain and Japan’s match as the match ended 4-2 against Costa Rica. Germany had done its part, but it was now up to Spain to do theirs. And did Spain even have a motive to? The Spain and Japan match quietly ended 2-1 with Japan as the winners. Once again, Germany had been knocked out of the World Cup in the group stages. Germany was left with a lot of regret. If only they had held onto their lead against Japan. If only they had finished the job against Spain. If only they had maintained their focus against Costa Rica. The nation that had once beaten host nation Brazil 7-1, that blew handed many top teams famously big losses, had seemed to lack that same ruthlessness against a Costa Rica team they showed they could easily score goals against in the waning minutes of their tournament.
          
           <br><br>13 semifinals in 18 tournaments. 8 World Cup final appearances. 4 stars. Not a single failure to reach at least the quarter finals except in 1938. Between 2018 and 2022, this record was shamed by two generations of players, the group comprised of the 1995/1996-born players led by Joshua Kimmich, and the winners of the 2014 World Cup. Admittedly it is still an unbelievable record of 13 semifinals in 20 tournaments, but what can you say? Accepting this is not the standard of German football. So what went wrong, and how can Germany move forward and return to the peak of global football?

        <p>
            Now that we have retold the recent events, it is time to diagnose the problems and look for solutions. But as shameful as a second consecutive group stage exit might seem, we have to ask whether Germany was really that bad in the tournament.
 
<br><br>Following the group stages the stats coming out were absurd. Germany had managed an insane 6.35 xG against Costa Rica. In fact, they had the highest xG of any nation with a total of 11.12 xG in the group stage and remained 3rd place in the entire tournament behind only the two teams that reached the final itself. Many people mock them: if there had been an xG champion of the World Cup, Germany would have been it. But in the end, xG is what is expected, not what actually happened. And in the end, Germany are out of the World Cup. xG suggests that Germany "performed well". If they had just gotten a bit more luck on their side - perhaps if Spain did their part or if that second Japanese goal which took the lead against Spain had rolled an inch further and gone out of play - Germany would have been able to progress. After all, Germany did their part in response to their debacle against Japan, they got the points against Spain and Costa Rica.  Then again, a nation like Germany should never be putting themselves in a position to rely on other nations to help them. But if Group E had someone else in place of Spain, a nation that isn’t ranked among the World Cup’s top teams, Germany could easily have rebounded from the mess of a game that was Matchday 1, and advanced from Group E. Against a lesser team than Spain a win would have been all but guaranteed by this German team and Germany’s readings of the table would be 6 points and progression from Group E rather than 4 and going out on goal difference to Spain. Germany are a clearly potent team, but not quite what they should be. Just a few issues that need to be fixed. So let us fix the German National Team, taking all the results of the Hansi Flick era into consideration.
 
<br><br>There are some very easily diagnosed problems in this German team that everyone sees: they don’t finish their chances and they don’t defend with complete focus for 90 minutes - they always seemed to perform well, but then collapse after 70 minutes against teams, a trend that had showed up against the likes of England and the Netherlands leading up to the tournament. So it seems very easy: get a striker, and defend better. One of the less talked about aspects of the tournament is also that some of the goals scored by Japan and Costa Rica were easily saveable, but the great Manuel Neuer had made a mess of it. So a third consideration: a new goalkeeper - Neuer will be hard to replace in any case, he’s probably the greatest goalkeeper of all time. But someone world class would suffice, and preferably someone who has good skills playing with the ball at his feet. There are options - Marc-Andre ter Stegen, and the talent once identified as Neuer’s successor, Alexander Nübel. The defenders will be a bit harder to figure out as Niklas Süle and Nico Schlotterbeck are considered among the best German defenders, yet let down the nation. Antonio Rüdiger somewhat escapes blame here. Schlotterbeck is young and was in terrible form heading into the World Cup as it is his first season for Borussia Dortmund, so perhaps in future tournaments he’ll find his feet again. Süle, though, was once considered the biggest defensive talent in the world and has seemed to lose his passion for football. It is up to him to prove us wrong. There are also some very promising younger options coming up for Germany. 
 
<br><br>The striker position, though, doesn’t seem to have many immediate options. Perhaps Niclas Füllkrug who did well at the World Cup - but might not quite have the quality of the rest of these Champions League winning players, and Moukoko who is still quite young. There is some sentiment that a taller striker, someone who can serve as a target man or play with his back to the goal while in the box, should be in Germany’s number 9 spot. This would eliminate Moukoko. I disagree with this sentiment, though, it is simply about getting someone who can get the goals. As already obvious, the performances are there, the finishing touches aren’t. But in any case, Germany scored the goals they needed to win, but didn’t defend. Solving at least one of these issues - finishing and defending - would have seen Germany through and honestly, probably making a deep run given the overall level of the tournament as a whole. More on the striker position in the last section.
 
<br><br>But the third dimension to this is perhaps the most important one: renewing the German football mentality. As I already mentioned, the defensive problems in the tournament and leading up to it were not all-game long but mostly in the later stages of the game while Germany led. Those moments were also not really defined by a lack of defensive focus, but a general lack of focus - offensively too. What was lacking first and foremost in this German team, was hunger - the mentality that assured that Germany was never out of the game, the mentality that made Germany the most ruthless nation in international football with the most impressive head-to-head results sending constant shockwaves through the world. This is the mentality that led to even the least talented generations of Germany finding themselves in the World Cup semifinals, and winning as heavy underdogs in the 1954 World Cup final against Hungary - it is often said, “a good German team wins the World Cup, a not-so-good German team makes at least the semifinal”. Gary Lineker’s famous quote was that “football is a simple game: 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and in the end, the Germans always win.” Now compare the two quotes, and take recent results into consideration. What is missing most from this current era? It is not a striker, it is not better defenders, though those would certainly help: it is the mentality that has defined German football since the beginning. Where is Bastian Schweinsteiger bleeding against Argentina to ensure that Germany lifts the trophy? Where is Franz Beckenbauer continuing on with a broken arm and marshaling the German team to fight on against Italy in the 1970 semifinals? These are the things missing from the current generation of Germany. It is the mentality, defined by its lack of leadership and a lack of winning habits.
 
<br><br> Regarding the lack of winning habits, Germany simply needs to stop going through the motions once they take the lead - they have to WIN games. This lack of winning habits is easily seen in a team that makes inexcusably sloppy passes to start the second half of matches they have leads in, and shows defensive carelessness after 70 minutes have passed and the games enter its waning moments. That is the behavior of a team that doesn’t believe the opposition can damage them, and haven’t become winners yet. So Germany, to retake their rightful throne at the top of world football, must re-establish winning habits. As silly as this sounds, they should look to the examples of Italy and Argentina, the winners of the last Euro and World Cup, respectively. Italy entered the Euros on a 30+ game streak without losing, and so did Argentina for the World Cup. As silly as it sounds, I am saying that Germany must re-establish those winning habits in games that had previously been seen as meaningless - friendlies and Nations League matches. Rediscover the environment of a team that never takes their foot off the gas, even in these meaningless games - be the team that will continue to score goal after goal as their predecessors had. Don’t hesitate to embarrass the opposition. This Germany team showed they have the potential to win by large margins even against good teams, they just aren’t the champions that will actually go and do so. Seize the opportunities to win, win those meaningless games and become a team that has winning habits once again. Once those habits are instilled, Germany won’t be at the mercy of enemies and fate as they were in Group E.
 
<br><br>The other aspect of the German mentality is finding the leader of the team again. They had Beckenbauer, Matthäus, Kahn, Ballack and Lahm in the past. But there is no leader in this team who will ensure that the rest of the players continue to fight even when it seems like they have already concluded the game, there is no leader in this team who will wake up sleeping players. To have that winning mentality, it must start from the team’s leadership and this is where I must hold Joshua Kimmich to a different standard than his peers. He played well in the tournament, but he wasn’t the leader that he says he wants to be, and that the German public expects him to be - Kimmich was one of the players opening up the second half with sloppy passes. Finding that leader is not exactly easy - it requires an individual who will step up. Kimmich seemed to be that player, but didn’t demonstrate that he is in this World Cup. It is harsh - he is one of the world’s best players, but he hasn’t seized the chance to become a legendary one just yet. Maybe he will improve in future tournaments. This is also to say, that when Germans wonder about their youth development, it’s not so much the talent that they should be worried about - more on that in the next and last section - but the mentality of the players coming through the ranks. Are they winners, or just talented individuals? And if they aren’t winners, help them to become so without sacrificing their individuality and skill. This isn’t something that needs some big fix, rather it is just a call to pay a little more attention. The upcoming players are loaded with special talents: those who are just now breaking into the professional level (or even in some cases, star players already) and those coming through the youth ranks - they simply need to be instilled with the will to win, and a sense of the history of German football. Let them know what they are a part of, and in whose footsteps they follow.

            <h3>Part 4: The Future Talents of Germany</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
            Much has been made of a downfall of German football, and as I mentioned earlier, a lot of this has been pinned on German youth development falling behind the likes of France, England and Brazil. Between the years of 1997 - 2000, I can certainly see the case. Very few promising German talents emerged from those age groups. Just a few big names came out of those years - Kai Havertz, Nico Schlotterbeck and David Raum. It is a testament to German football, then, that this “weak age group” was able to win the 2021 edition of the U21 Euros. 
 
           <br><br>The current U21 cycle is mostly made up of 2001 and 2002 born players, partly due to the renewed depth of talent in those age groups, as well as a lack of talent from 2000. There are many players who will make it as professionals in these age groups, but while more than 1997-2000, only a select group of them have genuine German international potential. These are Karim Adeyemi and Armel Bella-Kotchap who were already part of the World Cup squad (though few minutes were given to either), Malick Thiaw, Lazar Samardžić and goalkeeper Noah Atubolu. There’s also maybe Tom Krauß, Ansgar Knauff and Kevin Schade. A good age group, but on the whole, the French and English have stronger talents from these years.
 
           <br><br>But the younger age groups are where the true renaissance of German talent begins: Jamal Musiala, who was generally regarded as Germany’s best player in the 2022 World Cup and had the second most dribbles completed in the entire tournament despite only having played the three games (behind only Kylian Mbappé), Florian Wirtz who had to miss the tournament due to injury but was already becoming one of the faces of the Bundesliga before that, Youssoufa Moukoko whose enormous potential has been watched since the age of 12 and has just begun to find his feet as a professional, and the young left-back Luca Netz. The four, along with the likes of Armel Bella-Kotchap, should form one of the most formidable cores in international football for a long, long time. Each have the potential to truly make their own individual stamp on the history of German football, and as a collective, form something truly formidable. In the age groups following them, German youth development has not slowed down one bit.
 
           <br><br>In those age groups afterwards, Germany has many midfield - especially attacking midfield - talents coming through. The striker position is also returning as a strength for German football. The primary weakness remains at the right-back position, which there are just a few options for. I’ll have another article coming which will dive deeper into these age groups, but for now, just know that the talent is already somewhat present, and it is increasing in the years to come. Germany must be ready with a winning culture and winning habits, as well as a responsibility to the history of their national team, when these talents have matured.
 
           <br><br>The last solution to many of Germany’s problems is simple: look to the future, nurture it, believe in it. Built them up to become winners. If Germany can do that, glory is in sight again for German football.
